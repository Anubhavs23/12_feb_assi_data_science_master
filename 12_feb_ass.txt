Q5:- What are custom Exception in python ? why do we need custom Exceptions? explainwith an example.

Ans:-Like standard exception classes, custom exceptions are also classes. Hence, you can add functionality to the custom exception classes like: Adding attributes and properties. Adding methods e.g., log the exception, format the output, etc.

Q6:- Create a  custom exception class.Use this class to handle an exception.


class age_correction(Exception):
    def __init__(self,msg):
        self.msg=msg
   
   
def correctage(age):
    if age<0:
        raise age_correction("age is negative :: ")
    elif age>200:
        raise age_correction("age is to hig to accept :; ")
    else:
        print("age is accepted ")

try:
    
    age=int(input("etr age : "))
    correctage(age)
except age_correction as e:
    print(e)
